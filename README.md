## ðŸ“– Presentation

EduFlix is a project developed solely for study purposes, aimed at exploring the latest techniques within the Qt Framework using QML in its most recent version. Initially conceived as a challenge presented during a technical job interview, this project serves as a practical exploration of modern Qt development methodologies and practices. Feel free to explore the codebase and experiment with the features implemented

---

## ðŸ”Ž Practical Concepts Covered
 - [X] Qt Framework Latest Version 6.5.3
 - [X] Qt Modules
 - [X] Qt Models
 - [X] Components Reusability
 - [X] Logic-Design Separation in QML using .ui.qml files
 - [X] Responsive Layouts using QtQuick.Layouts: Implements layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations
 - [X] SOLID Concepts: Utilizing dependency inversion with the 'core' library, enabling the QML application to adapt to any data source. In case of API changes or the need to switch to a different API, the application remains flexible and extensible
